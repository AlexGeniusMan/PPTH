            <div className="information">Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (or PPTH) is the fictitious teaching
                hospital where House is set. It is located in Princeton, New Jersey on Prospect Street (as seen on
                Chase's GPS when he rushes to the hospital in After Hours) The hospital presumably is located near the
                neighboring township of Plainsboro. Princeton University's Frist Campus Center is used in the aerial
                screen shots. It was apparently based on a hospital near where series co-creator Bryan Singer grew up.
